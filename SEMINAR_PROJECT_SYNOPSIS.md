# Project Synopsis: Synapse AI - An Agentic RAG Platform for Diagnostic Radiology

## 1. Problem Statement

In modern radiology, the most significant bottleneck is not the imaging itself, but the time-consuming and cognitively demanding process of creating the final diagnostic report. Radiologists are under immense pressure to interpret an increasing volume of complex scans, leading to burnout and potential delays in patient care. Furthermore, the application of generative AI in this high-stakes field is often hindered by concerns over reliability and factual accuracy ("hallucination").

The Synapse AI project was initiated to solve this challenge by creating an intelligent "co-pilot" that accelerates the reporting workflow while ensuring the highest degree of accuracy and trustworthiness.

## 2. Core Technology & Architecture

Synapse AI is a cloud-native web application built on a modern, production-grade technology stack.

*   **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend & AI Orchestration:** Google Genkit, Next.js Server Actions
*   **AI Model:** Google Gemini (`gemini-1.5-pro-latest`)
*   **Database:** Google Firestore (for the Case History Learning Loop)
*   **Deployment:** Docker, Google Cloud Build, Google Cloud Run

### Key Architectural Pillars:

1.  **The Synapse Wrapper API:** The core intellectual property of the platform. This is a proprietary, centralized API layer that provides a secure and structured interface to all external knowledge bases (e.g., Radiopaedia, IMAIOS) and internal databases. It is responsible for modality-aware analysis, ensuring the AI applies the correct techniques for CT, MRI, X-ray, etc.

2.  **MLOps & CI/CD Pipeline:** The entire system is designed for continuous integration and deployment. Using a `Dockerfile` and a `cloudbuild.yaml` configuration, any code change is automatically built, containerized, and deployed to a scalable, serverless Google Cloud Run environment with zero downtime.

## 3. AI Methodology: Agentic, Tool-Augmented RAG

The primary innovation of Synapse AI is its advanced AI methodology, which moves beyond simple chatbots into a more sophisticated reasoning framework.

*   **Agentic System:** The Gemini model is configured to act as an autonomous **agent**. Given a goal (e.g., "analyze this scan"), it can independently decide which tools from its toolkit it needs to use to accomplish the task.

*   **Tool-Augmented:** The AI agent has access to a suite of specialized tools, including:
    *   `searchClinicalKnowledgeBase`: To get definitions of radiological terms.
    *   `searchImaiosAnatomy`: To look up detailed anatomical structures.
    *   `findCaseExamples`: To query its own internal database of past, expert-verified cases.
    *   `extractDicomMetadata`: To read and understand critical metadata from DICOM files.

*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** The system is a prime example of RAG. The AI doesn't invent answers; it **retrieves** factual information using its tools and then **augments** its generative capabilities with this grounded, verifiable data. This dramatically increases the reliability and accuracy of its output.

*   **Continuous Learning Loop:** By saving every finalized report back into its case history database, the AI's knowledge base grows with every use, creating a powerful feedback loop that makes the system more intelligent over time.

## 4. Conclusion

The Synapse AI project successfully demonstrates the design and implementation of a modern, scalable, and commercially viable AI platform. By employing an Agentic RAG architecture and building around a proprietary data API, it provides a blueprint for creating trustworthy and powerful AI co-pilots for high-stakes professional domains.
